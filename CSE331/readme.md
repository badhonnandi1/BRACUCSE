CSE331 Course Review - Automata and Computability
CSE331 is one of the most renowned and foundational courses in the CSE curriculum. While it is commonly referred to as Theory of Computation in many universities, BRAC University offers it under the name Automata and Computability. This course provides a deep understanding of the core computations and their underlying mechanisms, helping students grasp how computational processes work.

For example, you'll get an initial idea of how a compiler reads strings and processes them step-by-step—a fascinating and fundamental concept for computer scientists.

Syllabus Overview
The course is divided into two main sections:

Before Midterm:
Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
Regular Expressions (RE)
Regular Operations

Syllabus Overview
The course is divided into two main sections:

Before Midterm:
Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
Regular Expressions (RE)
Regular Operations
After Midterm (Up to Final):
Context-Free Grammar (CFG)
Pushdown Automata (PDA)
DFA to RE Conversion
Pumping Lemma
Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)
CYK Algorithm
Note: The exact topics may vary slightly between semesters (±1 topic).

Why This Course Is Important
The concepts covered in this course have significant applications in areas like:

Compiler Design
Language Processing
Software Development
It also helps students understand the deep-level functionalities of programming languages, such as how they process and execute instructions. This foundational knowledge can be incredibly useful in advanced topics and real-world applications.
